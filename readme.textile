Greetings,

MS Img Saver is a FieldType for "Brandon Kelly's FieldFrame":http://github.com/brandonkelly/bk.fieldframe.ee_addon/tree/master.

*This FieldType is compatible with Brandon Kelly's FF Matrix FieldType*.


*Setup*

# Download the extension and place the ff_ms_img_saver folder under fieldtypes inside your extensions folder.
# Enable the FieldType in the FieldFrame Extension Settings
# Use it in a template just like you would any other custom field.  It will spit out the full URL to the img ou have uploaded (i.e. http://example.com/images/uploads/13/uploaded_img.jpg).
# Enjoy :)

Let me know if you have any questions.
